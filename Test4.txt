Trump mulls entry ban for other nations than China
The US government is considering denying entry for travelers from countries where the new coronavirus is spreading, not just those from China.

President Donald Trump was asked by reporters on Friday if Washington will take steps for travelers from elsewhere. He said the government may do that "at a right time."

Washington already bars foreigners from entering the US if they have been to China within the past 14 days.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said four new suspected cases were reported on Friday in the west coast states of California, Oregon, and Washington.

Three of the four people have never traveled to countries where infections continue to spread. How they contracted the virus is not known. The CDC suspects community spread in all three cases. It will test them to see if they actually have the virus.

Observers say Washington is apparently trying to minimize the social and economic impact of the ongoing outbreak as the number of cases increases.
