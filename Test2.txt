China coronavirus infections top 80,000
The number of people infected with the new coronavirus in mainland China has exceeded 80,000.

Chinese health authorities say 42 more people died of the coronavirus in Hubei Province on Sunday, pushing up the death toll for China to 2,912.

The number of new infections was 202, bringing the total for China to 80,026. Six of the new patients were found outside Hubei Province. The number of new patients found outside the province has remained in single digits for four days in a row.

The head of the Chinese health authorities' expert team, Zhong Nanshan, and other researchers have published an analysis of the coronavirus in a US medical journal.

They say more than half of the 1,099 people who were infected in China by January 29 did not have fevers when they were hospitalized.

The researchers also say 17.9 percent of 877 patients without serious symptoms did not present any abnormalities in examinations using X-rays and other methods.

They urge people to remain on the alert because these factors make diagnosis difficult in the early stages of the disease.
